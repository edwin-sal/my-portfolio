			<h1>Edwin Bañago's Webpage</h1>

			<p>Hello! My name is Edwin. I'm from <span class="green">Tarlac, Philippines</span>.</p>

			<p>
				I'm a recent graduate of <a href="https://shorturl.at/ZBClm" target="_blank">Tarlac State University</a>, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,
				graduating as <span class="green">Magna Cum Laude</span>.</p>
			</p>

			<p>Through my 4-year stay at University, I was able to learn and explore several skills particularly in Programming focusing on <span class="green">Web and App development</span>.</p>

			<p>I aspire simplicity and cleanliness in my personal work but I am also committed in understanding different perspectives and exploring new skills!</p>

			<p>As a Student, I really enjoyed working with Web but I am now <span class="green">looking for opportunities</span> to grow as a Professional.</p>

				<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YNHQUa.webp" alt="Beng & Beng product page screenshot">

				<p>
					Beng & Beng is the highlight of my Internship at Armada Logics during my senior year at the University. This is a 3-person group project where I stepped up as the Team Leader. I divided the tasks, assigned them, and shared my knowledge about Git and Github for smoother collaboration. Eventually, hard work paid off as we were able to receive good feedback from our mentors.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is an E-commerce site focused on Front-end development and collaboration. We applied all the techniques and skills we learned from our mentors throughout our Web Fundamentals Course.

				<h2><a href="https://www.studeefy.online/">Studeefy</a></h2>

				<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YNHCLu.webp" alt="Studeefy screenshot">

				<p>
					Studeefy is a Learning Management System (LMS) that I developed for our capstone project at university. Unlike any other LMS, Studeefy has an AI-powered that stands out compared to competition. It automates quiz and flashcards creation.
				</p>

				<p>
					The automated feature works by the user uploading a document preferably containing educational content. The text content of the document are then extracted and passed to OpenAI's GPT API and with the  instructions given, it will pass back a formatted content that can be used to create flashcards and quizzes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Aside from automation, Studeefy also pack very similar features to MS teams as it was the main insipiration of it. Virtual classes, quizzes, assignments, messaging, and file uploads! all of these happening in Studeefy.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is definitely the best one I have built yet but I am confident I can still build a better one.

				<h2><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P20oAtf_LI-35BGSxul-L4lpe9qHz1Iv?usp=sharing">Pokemon Guessing Game</a></h2>

				<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YNHNwL.webp" alt="Pokemon Guessing Game app screenshot">

				<p>
					Up to this date, I still have not thought about giving it a proper name so i guess it will still be called the Pokemon Guessing Game. This one is definitely the most fun i have built. its an Android app but built using Web technologies such as React and Ionic.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					How does it work? well if you have read the title then you already know. Btw, this one uses PokeAPI which is great for getting information about Pokemons. Additionally, it can store date such as scores and user info using local storage.

				<h2><a href="https://edwin-sal.github.io/tictactoe_wd_cs/">!TicTacToe</a></h2>

				<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YNH47B.webp" alt="!TicTacToe screenshot">

				<p>
					Why is there a "!" in the name? well if you are a fellow programmer then you know that "!" means "not", and this tictactoe is NOT your ordinary tictactoe!
				</p>

				<p>This project is my first dance with Javascript. It was a nightmare as i had to finish it in the weekened while needing to learn about min-max-algorithm.</p>

				<p>
					Yup, this one uses min-max-algorithm (thanks to the guy from freecodecamp who provided the algorithm). This means that you won't be fighting against fiddle humans, but with unbeatable algorithm.</p>

				<p>Forget about winning on this one. Be grateful if you can even get a draw.</p>

				<img src="https://s6.imgcdn.dev/YNHiVw.webp" alt="RentEZ system screenshot">

				<p>
					Before getting my hands dirty with web development, I first had experience developing desktop GUI using Java swing. This is a system i built for our OOP class at university.
				</p>

				<p>
					Not much to say about this one except for some reason, I don't have a proper screenshot of this project. This image is from the moment i finished developing it. the built-in date and time feature is the proof as i remember finishing this project from 9am to 4am.</p>

				<p>
					Also, have I not mentioned yet that it also connects to MySQL? Cool stuff, it was magical actually.

			<h1>What I'm doing now</h1>

			<article>
				<h4>Updated August 25, 2025</h4>
			
				<p>What's Javascript if no Typescript?</p>
			
				<p>Time to learn it I guess. The Typescript handbook is a great resource btw.</p>

				<h4>Updated August 18, 2025</h4>
			
				<p>As I browsed through endless Job Applications online, I found a reocurring pattern. One skill is always almost present, that is Node.js</p>

				<p>I already had experience with Node.js when I integrated GPT-4 on our Capstone Project (<a href="https://www.studeefy.online">Studeefy</a>) but that's about it.</p>

				<p>I realized that if I want to improve my overall skills and become worthy of employment, I would have to spend more time learning Node.js and becoming a "REAL" fullstack developer.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h4>Updated July 21, 2025</h4>

				<p>It's been three days since graduation, and I'm now preparing to enter the tech industry!</p>

				<p>I'm currently taking care of getting necessary IDs and requirements for employment.</p>

				<p>I'm also refreshing my skills in Web Development to ensure I pass the qualifications of potential employers.</p>
